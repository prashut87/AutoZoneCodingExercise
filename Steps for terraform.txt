In the code above, we have to customize the following parts:

<path_to_service_account_key_json>: Replace this with the path to your service account key JSON file.
<your_project_id>: Replace this with your GCP project ID.
<your_project_region>: Replace this with the region where you want to create the Pub/Sub topics.
var.topic_count: This variable specifies the number of topics you want to create. The default value is set to 10,000.
Save the above code to a file with a .tf extension, e.g., pubsub_topics.tf.

To deploy the configuration, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the .tf file.
Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform configuration.
Run terraform plan to preview the changes that Terraform will make.
If the plan looks correct, run terraform apply to create the Pub/Sub topics.
